## The Big O  
- is used to express the performance or complexity of an algorithm. and can be used to represent the amount of time it takes to complete a task or the amount of space it takes up.

 #### The following are some of the most prevalent Big O Notation orders:<br>
1-**O(1)** describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time  regardless of the size of the input data set.

2-**O(N)** describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
 
3-**O(NÂ²)** represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

4-**O(2^N)** denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set 

- Logarithms<br>
 **Binary search** It operates by picking the data set's middle element and comparing it to a target value.
