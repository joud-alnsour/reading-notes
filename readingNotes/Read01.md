## Pain and Suffering
this page talks about the amount of effort and perseverance durin this course , and that the more effort you make,the more your experience and giving in python increases, and we should use our free time to learn,to be the creative programmers of the future<br>

## The Big O  
- is used to express the performance or complexity of an algorithm. and can be used to represent the amount of time it takes to complete a task or the amount of space it takes up.

 The following are some of the most prevalent Big O Notation orders:<br>
1-**O(1)** describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time  regardless of the size of the input data set.

2-**O(N)** describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
 
3-**O(NÂ²)** represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

4-**O(2^N)** denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set 

- Logarithms<br>
 **Binary search** It operates by picking the data set's middle element and comparing it to a target value.<br>

## Python

- There is no type for names, and there is no scope for values.
- Python is invoked through assignment rather than by value or reference.
- Float, int, tuples, and strings are immutable types.
- The name of a variable must begin with a letter or the underscore character.
- A number cannot be the first character in a variable name.
- Objects, lists, values , keys, and everything to the left of an assignment are all attributes.
