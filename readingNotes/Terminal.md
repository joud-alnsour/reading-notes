# Summarization for Terminal:
## The Command Line
 ### What is the Command Line:
 is the system's text-based user interface. You can enter commands by typing them on the keyboard, and you'll get feedback in the same way that text does.
 ### How do I get to one:
 Reading from [this](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php)

 >Opening a terminal is fairly easy. I can't tell you exactly how to do it as every system is different but here are a few places to start looking.
If you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.
If on Linux then you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities. Alternatively you may be able to 'right-click' on the desktop and there may be an option 'Open in terminal'.
If you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client. A rather good one is Putty (free) . 

## The Basic Navigation
- **Print Working Directory (pwd)**:this command  to remind what is your path current or present working directory {where your location are}.
- **list (ls)**:this command It show what's inside the directory {the contents of items}
- **Change Directories (cd)**:this command to move path to another directory.
- **Path** is a means to get to a particular file or directory on the system.

  - two types of paths:

       1- Absolute path 
  
       2- Relative path
