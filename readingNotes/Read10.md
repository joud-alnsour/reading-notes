# Stacks
- It is made up of Nodes. Each Node in the stack has a reference to the next Node in the stack.
- Plates are stacked in a similar manner. When it comes to using the plate, start with the one on top, which was stacked last.
- FILO stands for "First In, Last Out," while LIFO stands for "Last In, First Out."
- Common methods:
   - push: The node at the very top of the stack. O(1)
   - pop: The nodes at the top of the stack that have been eliminated. O(1)
   - top: The very top of the heap.
   - peek: Look at the top Node's value. Peek will throw an exception if the stack is empty. O(1)
   - isEmpty: Returns a boolean if the stack is empty. O(1)
# Queues
- Analogy:Make a line of people waiting. The individual who is first in line will be attended to.
- FIFO: LILO (Last In Last Out) stands for First In First Out.
- Common methods:
  - enqueue: To the back, add a Node. O(1)
  - dequeue: Remove the Node from the rear. O(1)
  - peek: look at the value of the front node. O(1)
  - isEmpty: Return boolean if the Queue is empty. O(1)
