# What is Risk Analysis
 **What is the purpose of risk analysis?**<br>
When risk analysis is used at the start of a project, it exposes potential trouble areas. It is easier for developers and managers to mitigate risks once they are aware of the danger regions.<br>

**Risk Identification**<br>
The risk identification procedure includes several different types of risks. The following are some of them:

- Business Risks: The most typical risk linked with our topic is this one. It's the risk posed by your organization or your customer, not by your project.

- Testing Risks: You should be familiar with the platform you're working on as well as the software testing tools you'll be using.

- Premature Release Risk: Analyzing the risk involved with releasing substandard or untested software necessitates a good bit of information.

- Software Risks: You should be aware of the dangers that come with the software development process.

**The perspective of Risk Assessment**<br>
There are three perspectives of Risk Assessment:
- Effect
- Cause
- Likelihood

**How do you conduct a risk analysis?**<br>
There are three steps to this process:

- Looking for the danger

- Examining the consequences of each specific risk

- Measures taken to address the identified risk
